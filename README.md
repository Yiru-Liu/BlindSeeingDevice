## Blind Seeing Device &mdash;Â Device Helping Visually-Impaired People Navigate Their Surroundings

### Problem

The problem that is addressed in this project is the high probability of visually impaired people bumping into things around them in an environment which they are not familiar with, potentially causing injury to the person.

### Solution

The solution aids the spatial awareness of those who are visually impaired. The solution is a set of devices consisting of ultrasonic distance sensors and vibration motors which attaches onto a piece of clothing, and warns the wearer when a potential barrier or object comes within a set distance of the wearer. By using electrical engineering, microcontroller programming, and electronic sensor technologies, the solution will alert visually impaired people if they walk within a certain distance of a potential barrier or object. The device will help visually impaired people to be alerted when coming within a proximity of a potential barrier or object. This will decrease the risk of possible injuries caused by bumping into nearby barriers or objects and will act as another layer of safety for the visually impaired.
